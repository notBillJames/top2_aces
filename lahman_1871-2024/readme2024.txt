1.1 Introduction

This database contains pitching, hitting, and fielding statistics for Major League Baseball from 1871 through 2024.  It includes data from
the two current leagues (American and National), the four other white "major" leagues (American Association, Union Association, Players League, and
Federal League), and the National Association of 1871-1875. 

This database was created by Sean Lahman, who pioneered the effort to make baseball statistics freely available to the general public. What
started as a one man effort in 1994 has grown tremendously, and now a team of researchers have collected their efforts to make this the
largest and most accurate source for baseball statistics available anywhere. (See Acknowledgements below for a list of the key
contributors to this project.)

None of what we have done would have been possible without the pioneering work of Hy Turkin, S.C. Thompson, David Neft, and Pete
Palmer (among others).  All baseball fans owe a debt of gratitude to the people who have worked so hard to build the tremendous set
of data that we have today.  Our thanks also to the many members of the Society for American Baseball Research who have helped us over
the years.  We strongly urge you to support and join their efforts. Please visit their website (www.sabr.org).

If you have any problems or find any errors, please let us know.  Any feedback is appreciated.

1.2 What's New 

Player stats have been updated through the latest season. Supplemental tables except CollegePlaying, Salaries, and Schools have been updated.  

Researched retirements from 2020-2025 to better identify players that should have their last game updated.

Updated biographical information for people where it differed in Retrosheet and Chadwick.

Corrected 2023 team data for DP and SHO, which were mistakenly presented as sums of the player totals and not team level stats.

Corrected team data where the stadium was incorrect for some clubs between 2019-2023.

Corrected park data for ARL03, which was mistakenly named Field of Dreams and not Globe Life Field.

Removed 2023 data from FieldingOF, which was only intended to go until 1955.

Standardized all state/province data for US, Canada, and Australia to use the postal codes only.

Filled in state data with known state/province/department/county/etc. data for all places of birth and death.

Corrected data where City, State, Country were misplaced in the fields.

Foreign placenames will now have diacritics for cities and states.

Standardized states for foreign countries (ex: Baden-Württemberg will always be Baden-Württemberg, not BR, Baden Württemberg, Baden-Wurttemberg, 
Baden, or Württemberg, etc.)

Added historical data for the following awards: 
   All-MLB Team awards
   Bob Feller Act of Valor Awards 
   MLB Players Choice awards
   Pitcher of the Month
   Player of the Month
   Player of the Week

1.3 Acknowledgements

Much of the raw data contained in this database comes from the work of Pete Palmer, the legendary statistician, who has had a hand in most 
of the baseball encyclopedias published since 1974. He is largely responsible for bringing the batting, pitching, and fielding data out
of the dark ages and into the computer era.  Without him, none of this would be possible.  For more on Pete's work, please read his own 
account at: http://sabr.org/cmsfiles/PalmerDatabaseHistory.pdf

Three people have been key contributors to the work that followed, first by taking the raw data and creating a relational database, and later 
by extending the database to make it more accessible to researchers.

Sean Lahman launched the Baseball Archive's website back before most people had heard of the world wide web.  Frustrated by the
lack of sports data available, he led the effort to build a baseball database that everyone could use. He created the first version
of the database and began to make it available for free download from his website in 1995.  

The work of Sean Forman to create and maintain an online encyclopedia at Baseball-Reference.com was a quantum leap for both fans and 
researchers. The website launched in 2000, provIding a user-friendly interface to the Lahman Baseball Database.  Forman and Lahman launched
the Baseball Databank in 2001, a group of researchers whose goal was to update and maintain the database as an open source collection available
to all.
  
Ted Turocy has done the lion's share of the work to updating the main data tables since 2012, automating the work of annual updates and linking
historical data to play-by-play accounts compiled by Retrosheet.

A handful of researchers have made substantial contributions to maintain this database over years. Listed alphabetically, they 
are: Derek Adair, Mike Crain, Kevin Johnson, Rod Nelson, Tom Tango, and Paul Wendt. These folks did much of the heavy lifting, and are 
largely responsible for the improvements made since 2000.

Others who made important contributions include: Dvd Avins, Clifford Blau, Bill Burgess, Clem Comly, Jeff Burk, Randy Cox, 
Mitch Dickerman, Paul DuBois, Mike Emeigh, F.X. Flinn, Bill Hickman, Jerry Hoffman, Dan Holmes, Micke Hovmoller, Peter Kreutzer, 
Danile Levine, Bruce Macleod, Ken Matinale, Michael Mavrogiannis, Cliff Otto, Alberto Perdomo, Dave Quinn, John Rickert, Tom Ruane,
Theron Skyles, Hans Van Slooten, Michael Westbay, and Rob Wood.

Many other people have made significant contributions to the database over the years.  The contribution of Tom Ruane's effort to the overall
quality of the underlying data has been tremendous. His work at Retrosheet.org integrates the yearly data with the day-by-day data,
creating a reference source of startling depth. 

Sean Holtz helped with a major overhaul and redesign before the 2000 season. Keith Woolner was instrumental in helping turn
a huge collection of stats into a relational database in the mid-1990s. Clifford Otto & Ted Nye also helped provide guidance to the early 
versions. Lee Sinnis, John Northey & Erik Greenwood helped supply key pieces of data. Many others have written in with corrections and 
suggestions that made each subsequent version even better than what preceded it. 

The work of the SABR Baseball Records Committee, led by Lyle Spatz has been invaluable.  So has the work of Bill Carle and the SABR 
Biographical Committee. David Vincent, keeper of the Home Run Log and other bits of hard to find info, was always helpful. The recent
addition of colleges to player bios is the result of much research by members of SABR's Collegiate Baseball committee.

Salary data was first supplied by Doug Pappas, who passed away during the summer of 2004. He was the leading authority on many subjects, 
most significantly the financial history of Major League Baseball.  We are grateful that he allowed us to include some of the data he 
compiled.  His work has been continued by the SABR Business of Baseball committee.  

Thanks is also due to the staff at the National Baseball Library in Cooperstown who have been so helpful over the years, including
Tim Wiles, Jim Gates, Bruce Markusen, and the rest of the staff.  

A special debt of gratitude is owed to Dave Smith and the folks at Retrosheet. There is no other group working so hard to compile and
share baseball data.  Their website (www.Retrosheet.org) will give you a taste of the wealth of information Dave and the gang have 
collected.

The 2023 version of the Lahman Database was updated and generated by Bryan Walko, who learned about databases from the Lahman Database 
back in the late 1990s.

The HallOfFame data has been expanded with the permission of Graham Womack and his fantastic research into Known Veterans and 
Era Committee candidates, 1953-current, with some additional data researched and deduced by Bryan Walko. This provides us valuable
insight into not just the people who were voted in by these committees, but also what we know about those who were considered
over time.

Thank you Sean, for donating the database to SABR, for overseeing the database for three decades, and for providing our first steps
into research during the internet era.

Thanks to all contributors great and small. What you have created is a wonderful thing.

1.4 Using this Database

This version of the database is available in Microsoft Access format, SQL files or in a generic, comma delimited format. Because this 
is a relational database, you will not be able to use the data in a flat-database application. 

Please note that this is not a stand alone application.  It requires a database application or some other application designed specifically
to interact with the database.

If you are unable to import the data directly, you should download the database in the delimited text format.  Then use the documentation
in section 2.0 of this document to import the data into your database application.
