## top2_aces
This project was created to compare Curt Schilling & Randy Johnson's performance in 2001 to other top 2 aces from other years on different teams.

### v 1.0
Right now it's current function is to just make something in Python, and to test out the concepts that I'm learning.
Later on in the project's life it will actually do what it's named and was created for. For now however, it will not.

### v 2.0
Finally getting around to comparing them to other pitchers
